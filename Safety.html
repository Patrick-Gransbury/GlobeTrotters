          <li>
            <h5>Before you Meet</h5>
            <p>Take your time getting to know people and don't rush! They will probably be just as cautious about meeting new people so make sure you get to know the other person before agreeing to meet them. Ask plenty of questions and screen for red flags - a perfect way of getting to know someone is to phone or video call them before meeting.</b></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Meet in Public</h5>
            <p>Meet for the first few times in a populated, public area - if you are pressured into going to a private location or their home, <b>Decline and Report them.</b></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Tell a Friend</h5>
            <p>Before meeting with someone, be sure to tell a friend or family member where, when and who you are meeting. Make sure your mobile is charged and ready to use at all times. Don't change plans when meeting so your friends/ family always know where you are. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Your Limits</h5>
            <p>If you are meeting for a drink - be aware of the affect of drugs and alcohol on you - they can impare your judgment, and alertness. If you feel presurised to take drugs or drink more than your comfortable with, hold your ground and end the meeting.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Transportation</h5>
            <p>Be in control of your own transportation. Plan how you are going to get to and from the location you met at. Don't accept a private ride and don't tell the other person where you live/ how your getting home (espeically if your walking). </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Don't Leave Anything Unattended</h5>
            <p>Make sure no personal items are left unattended - laptops and mobiles can be expensive so only take what is neccessary on your date. Make sure you keep your wallet on your person at all times. Only accept drinks served directly from the bartender/sever, do not leave your drink unattended. Many substances are odourless, tasteless and colourless so be careful.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>If you are Uncomfortable, Leave</h5>
            <p>It is ok to leave early, especially if you feel uncomfortable. If you have a bad feeling or you feel unsafe, ask a bartender/ server for help.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Discrimination</h5>

          <li>
            <h5>Do your Research</h5>
            <p>Get to know your destination in depth before you arrive. Currencies can change from country to country, and some countries use many currencies.

            <h5>Make Copies of Important Documents</h5>
            <p>You never know when you might need a copy of your passport, driver's license or another form of identification. Scan these documents and save online and print out hard copies. That way if you go on a trip you can take these expendable copies instead of loosing the originals.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Keep your Valuables Safe</h5>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Protect Yourself with Travel Insurance</h5>
